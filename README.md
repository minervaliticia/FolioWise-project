A portfolio optimization project

In this project, we aim to build a model that optimises stock portfolios.

Currently, this project is based on the SnP100 stocks. 

Dataset is from Polygon.io

Further development: We would like to increase the range of our dataset to SnP500 and eventually include securities such as cashflows, bonds and other commodities
